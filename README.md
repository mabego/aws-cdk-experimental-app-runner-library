# App Runner Experimental AWS CDK library

The code for my article [_Test Driving App Runner's Experimental AWS CDK Library_](https://periodical.pages.dev/posts/test-driving-app-runners-experimental-aws-cdk/).

This repository deploys a web app with App Runner and an Aurora database using AWS CDK.

Update `rootDomain` and `subDomain` in cdk.json to deploy with your custom domain.
